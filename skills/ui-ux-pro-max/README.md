# ui-ux-pro-max (placeholder)

This repository previously referenced `skills/ui-ux-pro-max` as a git submodule, but `.gitmodules` was missing.

To use the real skill, install it as a submodule properly or vendor it as normal files.

In CI, we keep this directory as a placeholder so git submodule cleanup does not fail.
