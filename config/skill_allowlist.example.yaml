# Skill Allowlist Configuration
# This file defines which agents can use which skills.
#
# Format:
# agent_allowlists:
#   <agent_id>:
#     - skill: <skill_name>
#       allowed: true|false
#       notes: Optional notes
#
# capability_mappings:
#   <capability_name>:
#     - skill: <skill_name>
#       priority: <number>  # Lower = higher priority
#       metadata:
#         key: value
#
# Special values:
#   skill: "*" = wildcard (all skills)
#   allowed: true = permit, false = deny
#
# Behavior:
#   - If no entry exists for an agent, all skills are allowed (backward compatibility)
#   - Wildcard entry ("*") applies to all skills not explicitly listed
#   - Explicit entries override wildcard
